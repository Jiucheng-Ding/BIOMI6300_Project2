File created!
This report is about Yellowstone microbe.The files were prepared for a grant proposal.
The name of the project was "Phototropy in eruptive hot springs". The project aims to discover the distribution and activity of metabolically diverse anoxygenic phototrophs across geothermal spings. 4 sample were collected for this project, from 2 locations of sampling (FC,JJ) and with each has two different temperatures (hot and cool). 
This R Markdown analysis aims to discover the role of temperature that may play in affecting the diversity and composition of the microbiome from the sample. 
The one that I care about the most is phylum composition.
