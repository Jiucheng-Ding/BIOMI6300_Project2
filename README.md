Hi:
This is the first README.md.
File created!
This report is about Yellowstone microbe.The files were prepared for
a grant proposal. The analysis aims to understand the alpha/beta diversity of the data set, identify the dominant phylum or species and understand the impacts of pH and temperature might do.

The one that I care about the most is phylum composition.
Data type: 
Raw sequence reads

PRJNA756970
